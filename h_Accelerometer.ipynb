    "A simple accelerometer could be constructed with a mass attached to a spring. The spring  would stretch by some amount due to Earth's gravity if oriented vertically (if it is horizontal, then there is no stretch). A spring accelerated vertically would change its length, from which we can evaluate its accelerating. Modern accelerometers are made on tiny silicon chips, but work on the same principles. Accelerometers often have 3 \"springs\" to measure acceleration in each direction. You can learn more about accelerometers on [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer)."

It's useful to read through the [datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Accelerometers/MMA8452Q-rev8.1.pdf) for this sensor, as there is lots of information we need in order to use the sensor it. You can also find it under the documents tab of [the SparkFun accelerometer](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13926) page or just Googling \"MMA8452Q datasheet\". The most important information is summarized in this notebook in order to get the accelerometer working.\n",

    "The accelerometer we are using communicates over I<sup>2</sup>C (explained in its own [notebook](h_I2C.ipynb)), which requires 2 wires for communication (**SDA** for serial data, and **SCL** for serial clock), and 2 wires for power (**3.3V** and **GND**). You can connect the pins of the accelerometer to the RPi using jumper wires in order to setup communication and power the chip; you'll notice that they have the exact same names. You can ignore pins I1 and I2.\n",

The master can then send data to the appropriate subordinate device, and all other devices ignore these data.
