The basic process for this lab is as follows: your code should wait until large seismic activity is detected, large enough to flip over the tilt switch. When the tilt switch flips, your code needs to take lots of data from the piezo element and from the accelerometer to record the earthquake behavior. \n",

    "    * Also store the time of each measurement in a NumPy array.\n",
    "    * Record data from the sensors continuously, i.e. do not use `time.sleep()`\n",
    "* Save all data arrays into a file.\n",
    "    * Put all arrays into a single file using `np.savez()` - see the [file I/O](s_NpFileIO.ipynb) notebook.\n",
