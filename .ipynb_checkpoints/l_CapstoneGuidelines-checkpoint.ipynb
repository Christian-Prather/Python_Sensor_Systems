    "This is a hands-on class, and therefore its final act will not be a final exam, but a capstone project. This will give you an opportunity to apply concepts and techniques learned in class to a project of your choice. We are setting-up a few rules in order to facilitate evaluation consistency, but otherwise we would like to see your ideas at work. We hope that you will turn this project into something practical and of interest to you, rather than just something you do for credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of possible projects is broad and open-ended. We have listed some example projects at the end of this notebook to provide some inspiration. If you need or would like to use additional sensors that are not available in the class kit, we can order parts from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/). Please let us know asap - be prepared to make the case why that sensor and its costs are justified. "
