    "Your goal is to convert a text file into a song whose play is triggered by the presense of a magnetic field. This midterm examination should take no more than 3-6 hours and has you design a simple curcuit and builds upon the Python concepts we have already practiced in class (up to but not including OOP). You may use course materials for reference and guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**:\n",
    "* Read in the song file (song.txt) that includes two colums of data for pitch and duration.\n",
    "* When a magnetic field is detected (Reed Switch closed), send those notes in one at a time to the buzz function that will play music on your Piezo speaker and flash the LED to the music.\n",
    "* Print a message to the screen and log the message with a timestamp to a logger.txt file (be creative, hint: look up f=open(fileName,'a') and f.write(logEntry)).\n",
    "* When the program is terminated (stopped), generate and show a plot of the pitch values.\n",

    "    * Use variables where appropriate (e.g., no hard coding of pin numbers, filenames, booleans)\n",
    "    * Use a a minimum one while loop, for loop, conditional (if/else)\n",
