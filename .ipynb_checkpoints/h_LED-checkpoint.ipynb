    "LEDs or [light emitting diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode) are semiconductor devices that produce light when a voltage is applied to them. They are relatively simple output devices and the Sparkfun sensor kit comes with LEDs in a variety of colors, including red, green, blue, yellow, and infrared (IR)."

    "Each LED can operate under a range of voltages. Generally speaking, higher frequencies require higher voltage, but that's beyond the scope of this class. The important thing to know is that these are maximum voltages that one should apply to the LEDs; giving them more voltage increases the current draw, which heats up the LED and can damage it. Most of the voltages for safe LED operation are below 3.3V (the voltage that the RPi uses), **so we need to include a current-limiting resistor in series with the LEDs**. One could calculate the optimal resistance for this, but in our case a single 330 Ohm resistor that came with the kit will do fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can flip the order of the LED and resistor, however LEDs only operate in one direction. Typically **the longer leg is connected to high voltage**. Reversing the LED will not damage it, it will instead just not produce light.\n",

    "If we want an LED to always be on, we can connect it between the 3.3V and GND pins of the wedge, but that's not very useful. Instead of the 3.3V pin, we can use one of the GPIO pins to control when the LED is on/off. \n",
