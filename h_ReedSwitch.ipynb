    "As a circuit element, reed switches act just like push buttons, except reed switches are activated by magnets. Inside the reed switch are ferrous materials that make an electrical connection when a magnet is brought nearby. You can learn more about reed switches on [this  page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_switch). If you want to know more about using switches in this class, see the [push button notebook](h_PushButton.ipynb)."

    "In order to use a reed switch as an input for a GPIO pin, the voltage on the pin needs to be 3.3V (logical high voltage) when the switch is in one state, and 0V (logical low voltage) when the switch is in the other state. Assuming one side of the switch is the only thing connected to the GPIO pin, it will be left in a floating state when the switch is open (no magnet), which can return random noise and random behavior. To fix this, we need to make use of a pull-up or pull-down resistor. You could add one to your circuit manually, but we will instead use the internal resistors of the RPi when writing the code for it. Assuming you use a pull-up resistor (causing logical high voltage when the switch is open), the other side of the switch needs to be connected to GND (causing logical low voltage when the switch is closed); see left image below. Alternatively you can flip the behavior of the reed switch by using a pull-down resistor and connecting the switch to 3.3V; see right image below.\n",
