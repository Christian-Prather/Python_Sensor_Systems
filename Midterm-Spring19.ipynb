    "\n",
    "Your goal is to convert a text file into a song whose play is triggered by the presense of a magnetic field. This midterm examination should take no more than 3-6 hours and has you design a simple curcuit and builds upon the Python concepts we have already practiced in class (up to but not including OOP). You may use course materials for reference and guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**:\n",
    "* Read in the song file (song.txt) that includes two colums of data for pitch and duration.\n",
    "* When a magnetic field is detected (Reed Switch closed), send those notes in one at a time to the buzz function that will play music on your Piezo speaker and flash the LED to the music.\n",
    "* Print a message to the screen and log the message with a timestamp to a logger.txt file (be creative, hint: look up f=open(fileName,'a') and f.write(logEntry)).\n",
    "* When the program is terminated (stopped), generate and show a plot of the pitch values.\n",

    "**Specific requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct on a breadboard the following that are all included in your kit (NOTE: I will be running your code on my curcuit, so it is critial that you use EXACTLY the following pin Numbers for testing/grading):\n",
    "    * Reed switch (setup and test with: h_ReedSwitch.ipynb) - GPIO PIN 27\n",
    "    * Square magnet (only used for triggering the Reed Switch)\n",
    "    * Piezo Speaker (setup and test with: h_Buzzer.ipynb) - GPIO PIN 25 \n",
    "    * LED - GPIO PIN 21\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be sure to practice incremental coding to accomplish the following requirements:\n",
    "    * Use variables where appropriate (e.g., no hard coding of pin numbers, filenames, booleans)\n",
    "    * Use a a minimum one while loop, for loop, conditional (if/else)\n",
    "    * Plot should have title, axis labels, and a legend (if appropirate)\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Create the following functions (at a minimum) to organize your code: \n",
    "    * setupPins() - a function to setup the input/output pins\n",
    "    * doFileIO(read=True) - a function to read in the file song.txt that returns an array/list if incoming boolean is true, otherwise, logs a message and a timestamp to an output file \"logger.txt\"\n",
    "    * buzz(pitch, duration) - a function for playing the song on the Piezo Speaker and flashing the LED to the music (working stub provided)\n",
