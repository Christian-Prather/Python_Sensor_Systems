    "Your goal for this lab is to create a night light: use the photoresistor to detect when it becomes dark (you can simulate darkness by covering it with your hands), then turn on an LED. How do you know when it has become dark enough? You need to use the potentiometer to set a threshold for the darkness at which to turn on the LED.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific lab requirements**:\n",
    "* Use the `readADC()` function in `spiUtils.py` to measure the voltages from the potentiometer and the photoresistor.\n",
    "    * Calculate the resistance of the photoresistor from the measured voltage.\n",
    "* Use the potentiometer voltage to determine the threshold **resistance** of the photoresistor.\n",
    "* Once the photoresistor **resistance** goes beyond the threshold set by the potentiometer, turn on an LED.\n",
    "    * Don't just compare the voltage outputs of the 2 sensors, **calculate the actual resistance** of the photoresistor and set a threshold resistance from the potentiometer voltage.\n",
    "* When it becomes light again (beyond the threshold), turn off the LED.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier for us to test your code, please have the potentiometer and photoresistor connected to channels 0 and 1 of the ADC respectively. Also connect the LED to GPIO pin 20. If you decide to do extra credit with different hardware, please specify the pin connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin your answer from the starter code provided below. Make use of knowledge acquired during previous labs. Add comments throughout your code so we can understand what it does. Even if you can't figure out how to write the code for something, a comment explaining what you wanted will get partial credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra credit**:\n",
    "* Figure out a way to slowly dim the light near the threshold using [pulse-width modulation (PWM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation) rather than instantly turning on/off.\n",
    "* Anything of your own creation that you feel is worthy of extra credit. Be sure to explain clearly your intentions."
